= FileWatcher service
`sample/sample-filewatcher-service`

The purpose of this service is to demonstrate how to read configuration and track its changes from a plane properties file using `java.nio.file.WatchService`.

Before using this service, must be specified the directory where the properties file located outside of the container and the path where the file located
inside the container. For this, the `docker-compose.local.wildfly.yml` compose file must be changed as follow:

* `CONFIG_PROPERTIES_FILE_PATH` environment variable define the properties file path inside the container
** `CONFIG_PROPERTIES_FILE_PATH: /home/customConfig/config.properties` (this is the default value)
* the directory of the properties file must be mounted to the container
** `./customConfig:/home/customConfig'`
